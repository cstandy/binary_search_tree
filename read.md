# Binary Search Tree implemented in C++

This project is developed in C++. The aim of the project is to design a system which stores data in a binary search tree which can perform different traversal methods.

User can build the binary search tree with the data from
1. read the data.txt file
2. allow the user to generate the number (1~99) of random variables (1~99). For example, entering 5 may generate [ 4, 22, 5, 16, 8 ].

and accomplish the following tasks
+ draw the binary search tree containing level and relations
+ print Preorder traversal
+ print Inorder traversal
+ print Postorder traversal
+ print Breadth-first traversal (form left-up to right-down)
    - implemented with queue
